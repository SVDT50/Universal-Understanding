      <h1>Reading in a Foreign Language: The Key to Fluency?</h1>
      <h2>How books help me to learn languages and what science says about that</h2>
    
      <article img scr="../images/bookstore.jpeg" alt="bookstore" class="blog-photo">

      <p>For me, a good book is one of the greatest joys in life. Settling down in a quiet place, feeling the weight of the book in your hands, smelling the scent of paper when you open it, and completely losing yourself in another’s most intimate thoughts. Can you imagine anything more romantic?</p>
      <p>Reading is my favourite pastime. Well, one of my favourites. Because if reading and language learning were to fight a battle, it would be a very close call.</p>
      <p>Language learning is my other great passion. I see language as the key to culture. Without language, you can observe a culture from the outside; you can hover around its edges and, if you’re very lucky, sometimes catch a glimpse of what it’s like on the inside, but you can never truly enter. If you speak a culture’s language, however, its gates will open wide, and you’ll be welcomed as an honoured guest.</p>
      <p>It was only natural for me to combine my love for the written word with, well, my love for the concept of words. I have been reading in foreign languages ever since I can remember. Shortly after I began reading books in my native language (Dutch), I started to read in English, too. In secondary school, I picked up French and German books, and during my college time, I added Spanish, Chinese, Swedish and Portuguese to the list as well.</p>
      <p>You might be asking yourself, dear reader, how I can speak all of those languages. Shall I let you in on a secret? I don’t really speak them all. What most people don’t realise is that reading a language is very different from speaking it. But it is, however, a crucial stepping stone to mastering a foreign language.</p>
      <p>This article will dive into why reading in a foreign language will help you reach your language goals, the scientific benefits of incorporating reading into your language-learning routine, and some practical tips to simplify the process. So, whether you’re reading this in your native language or not, I hope it offers useful insights to support your language-learning journey.</p>
   
      <h3>Why you should read in a foreign language</h3>
      
      <p>Have you been studying a foreign language for a while, cramming words and practicing grammar rules, but do you feel like you just can’t get past the beginner’s level? My one tip for language learners in this situation is to start reading! And don’t just stick to the cheesy example texts in your course book. Pick-up something real, something authentic; something that would also be consumed by native speakers of your target language.</p>
      <p>To illustrate the essential role of reading in language learning, I will tell you how it helped me to achieve fluency in English.</p>
      <p>Growing up in the Netherlands, specifically in the Amsterdam area, I was exposed to foreign languages from a very young age. For us Dutch people, it’s normal to watch foreign films with Dutch subtitles, instead of dubbing them into our native language, like is common in most other European countries. Also, many of our large cities, with Amsterdam being the prime example, function bilingually, with many bars, restaurants and shops employing English-speaking staff.</p>
      <p>So, just by living life, consuming media and being out and about in Amsterdam, I picked up a lot of words, especially in English. By the time I started formal English education in school, I could translate most of the words in my vocabulary lists; common expressions like “I don’t know” or “How have you been?” rolled off my tongue as naturally as any Dutch phrase. But when the time came to actually have a conversation in English, I was at a loss.</p>
      <p>My mind contained all the puzzle pieces: the pronunciation rules, vocabulary, some basic grammatical structures. But, at this young age, I did not yet know how to fit those pieces together.</p>
      <p>You see, dear reader, languages are like building materials; learning words and grammar rules is like acquiring the hammer, the nails and the planks, but just having the materials doesn’t enable you to build a house: you need to know how to make them work together. Just like building materials can be used for many different purposes, language allows its speakers to express themselves in many different ways. Language really is, like the cliché tells us, fluid.</p>
      <p>Fluency means being able to use language’s fluid nature to your advantage. That’s where reading comes in. In my English-learning journey, it was only when I started reading that I got a feel for how native speakers use the language to express themselves. It reinforced the basic structure of the language, while at the same time, showing me how to break out of that structure.</p>
      <p>Reading in English also provided me with ammunition for my further language learning journey; it exposed me to a wide range of vocabulary and it taught me how to deduct the meaning of new words from the general context.</p>
      <p>If there were a path from the beginner level to fluency, then there would be a cliff in the middle, right at the point where the learner has acquired a decent vocabulary and has familiarised themselves with the grammar rules but is not quite confident enough to speak the language yet. Many learners strand at the edge of this cliff and spend eternity looking into its daunting depths, but others realise that they can build a bridge over it. There are many ways to build this bridge, but for me, the most effective way has always been to start reading.</p>

      <h3>The science of reading in foreign languages</h3>

      <p>Dear reader, have you ever learned how to ride a bike? If so, I invite you to recall the learning process. Go ahead, think about the first time your feet hit the pedals. Do you see it? Good. Now, I’m no clairvoyant, but I’m going to predict two things about your bike-riding learning curve. Ready? One: there was a lot of falling. Two: you progressed by doing, not by watching.</p>
      <p>Learning to speak a language should be like learning to ride a bike; the focus should be on acquiring feeling, on getting comfortable with the sensation of speaking it, on finding the perfect balance in sentence structures. We should learn a language actively, not passively. That’s why organisations like the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) recommend that 90% of learning takes place in the target language itself.</p>
      <p>The ACTFL states that meaning-making (deducting the meaning of a word or phrase through context) is a very effective and natural way of learning to speak a language. Meaning-making is like solving a puzzle and, therefore, a very stimulating way to learn.</p>
      <p>Books are the perfect mechanism to expose yourself to a language and to bring meaning-making into practice. Reading a text allows you to absorb the language as a beautiful unit, rather than a mishmash of individual words and phrases.</p>
      <p>Meaning-making through reading is only possible if the reader is familiar with a sufficient amount of vocabulary, since there should be a basis which allows for comprehension of the contextual cues. Yet there should also be enough unknown words for the reader to be challenged.</p>
      <p>If you read in a foreign language, your efforts will most likely be paid off in an impressive increase of vocabulary knowledge. A study of Finnish students studying English concluded that eager pupils who read in their target language every day had a significantly larger vocabulary than their peers who read only read in English on a monthly basis; about 17% larger, on average.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, extensive reading in a foreign language has been linked to a broader cultural understanding; through reading authentic text, the reader is not only exposed to the target language but also to the culture(s) to which that language is respective. Reading also improves the learner’s understanding of grammar and syntax through exposure to correct structures; a process called implicit learning dramatically fuels students’ linguistic comprehension.</p>

      <h3>How to start reading in a foreign language?</h3>
        
      <p>Picking up a book in a language I’m trying to master is always a moment of confrontation for me. Imagine: you have put in many hours of studying, you’ve worked through listening exercises, drilled vocabulary and repeated grammar rules over and over again, just to find out that you are unable to make sense of the first page of a book you’ve been wanting to read. What a bummer.</p>
      <p>The journey of learning a foreign language is filled with moments of failure, and when we experience failure, we are often tempted to throw in the towel and give up altogether. But it is especially at these moments that we must motivate ourselves to push through.</p>
      <p>Believe me, I know how hard this can be. But, through many years of trial and error, I have found a few do’s and don’ts which help me to keep motivated to read in my target language.</p>

      <h4>1. Start with something a little below your level</h4>
      
      <p>Just like you don’t expect a five-year-old to understand Charles Dickens, you shouldn’t expect to be able to read Gabriel Garcia Marquez after a few months of Spanish studies. Many language learners opt for well-known books in their target language; classics. The thing with classics is that they are usually very difficult to understand. It can be very frustrating (and, therefore, demotivating) to keep encountering unfamiliar words.</p>
      <p>The good news is that there are books for every level of language learner. Are you a beginner? Then you should find an easy book to read; one that uses simple structures or maybe a children’s book. If you can grasp the gist of the book, you’ll be more motivated to push through and finish it.</p>        

      <h4>2. Read a book you already know</h4>

      <p>A good place to start when reading in a foreign language is a book that you have already read in your native language. This makes it so much easier because you already know the plot. The familiar context will help you to make sense of unfamiliar words.</p>
      <p>My first book in English was Harry Potter, which I had recently read in Dutch, too. I admit, I had to get used to the original names of the characters, since I had previously only known them by their Dutch equivalents, but after I had done so, understanding the rest of the story was a breeze.</p>
      
      <h4>3. Don’t focus on individual words but on the storyline</h4>
        
      <p>This is probably the single most important tip I have for anyone trying to read a book in a language that’s not native to them. When you first start to read in a foreign language, you will encounter a lot of words that you don’t know. It can be very tempting to lay down the book when you don’t understand something; you might think that it’s above your level or that you’re missing crucial details.</p>
      <p>But, if you find yourself thinking this, ask yourself whether you are still understanding the plot instead of the individual words and phrases. If your answer to that question is yes, it is imperative that you push through, because that’s when you can learn the definition of new words through context; that’s when the meaning-making, which we discussed earlier, starts. If you keep on reading, you’ll find that you progressively understand more words. This process is an absolute gold mine for language learning.</p>

      <h4>4. Don’t look up words while reading</h4>
        
      <p>If you’re like me, you may be tempted to look up the definition of every single word you don’t know in the dictionary. But, over time, I found out that this doesn’t really help you with understanding the story better.</p>
      <p>Interrupting your reading to look up words takes you out of the flow of the story and, therefore, disturbs your ability to deduct definitions from context. It’s much more effective to independently find out what a new word means instead of looking it up in the dictionary.</p>
      <p>I recommend you underline the words you don’t recognise immediately. Then, when you have finished the chapter, go back to the underlined words and see if you still don’t understand them. Chances are that you’ll be able to find out their meaning in hindsight. If not, look them up then, instead of during your reading.</p>
      <p>Dear reader, I know that reading in a foreign language can seem like a daunting exercise — a moment of confronting your own language abilities (or lack thereof). But trust me, it’s worth every moment of self-doubt. The most wonderful thing is that once you’ve done it with one language, it becomes much easier with the next. So, go to your local library, pick up that foreign book, and read it from beginning to end. I promise you, it will be worthwhile!</p>
