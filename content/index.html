    <section id="Language courses">
        <h3>Want to learn a foreign language?</h3>
            <p>At Universal Understanding, we believe that you can never truly get to know a culture without learing its respective language; you can roam around the parimeters, observe it from the outside, but without the linguistic key, you can never truly enter the cultural heartland. We are here to provide that key to you.</p>
            <p>Our courses aim to teach you a language through real-life content: content that a native speaker would consume, too. This way, you'll get to know the language in an authentic way, gaining knowledge through context, instead of in a static text-book-way. Our courses are designed for self-study, but everyone needs a little help sometimes. That's why we have a team of highly-skilled language teachers, with whom you can book a lesson at your convenience. This way, you can practice true interaction and you'll never be stuck with a question for long.</p>
